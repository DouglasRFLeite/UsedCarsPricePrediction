There they use the famous housing prices example with both Melbourn and Iowa data and guide you through creating **your first regression model** with the Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms.\n",

But this is my first time using Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms and it might as well be your first algorithm ever, so let's get right into it."

    "As you can see, that error actually means a 22.14% average error in the predictions for that dataset. Is it enough? It depends on the scenario, how much time and money one can spend to further improve this model and far more other factors. In our case, we still want to improve it by as much as we can (or at least for as much as this Kaggle course has taught us to).\n",

    "### Tuning the Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, I am aware the corect name is hyperparameters, but Kaggle did not get into that matter so neither will I. If you are unfamiliar, the parameters we are talking about are some characteristics of the Decision Tree that can interfere with its performance. We will not talk much about Overfiting or Underfiting here, but those two scenarios can happen and often worse the models performance. In the case of Decision Trees, one parameter we can adjust to improve the overall performance by fleeing from these problmens is the maximum number of leafs. Increasing the number of leafs will lead the model to fit to much the training data and perform poorly on other data such as the test data. On the other hand, if we have only a small number of leaves, it will not fit our data at all and perform pooly on train and test data alike. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, to try and solve that problemn and find out if it really is what is hurting our models performance, we shall test a few possibilities for the maximum number of leafs and chose the one with the best performance, or the smaller mean absolute error. "

Random Forests are an Ensemble application with just Decision Trees as building blocks for a greater joint model. It creates a large number of models and uses them in conjunction to predict our label and, in theory, it should work best than even the better performing single Decision Tree. We will use Scikit-learns RandomForestRegressor class for this test."
